## [Problem Statement](#problem-statement)
Develop a cost-effective system for volunteers to enroll, manage activities, and request certificates, while enabling nonprofit administrators to efficiently handle forms, attendance, and generate detailed reports.

## [Project Objectives](#project-objectives)
**Streamlining Volunteer Management**:
Our goal is to empower both volunteers and administrators
with a comprehensive, all-in-one website to manage events. We
strive to simplify and enhance the user experience by ensuring
that every feature and functionality is easily accessible within
three clicks.

## [Brief Overview](#brief-overview)
**Event Listing and Registration**: Volunteers can easily browse through a chronological list of events, obtain detailed information with a single click, and register seamlessly.

**Personalized Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface on the 'Home' tab presents volunteers with upcoming events and a snapshot of their participation history.

**Account Creation and Profile Management**: A streamlined process allows volunteers to create accounts and manage their profiles, keeping track of their participation and personal volunteer journey.

**Event Records and Certification**: Volunteers have access to their past events and can request or download certificates of attendance, providing a tangible record of their contributions.

**Blogging Platform**: A section for volunteers to view and publish blogs, encouraging community engagement and the sharing of experiences.

**Admin Event and Attendance Management**: Administrators can view, create, and manage events as well as take attendance with ease, ensuring efficient event coordination.

**Progress Tracking**: Both volunteers and administrators can track hours contributed and events attended, promoting a sense of achievement and motivation.

Each feature is designed to enhance the experience for both volunteers and organizers, streamlining processes, and fostering a sense of community and recognition within the platform.

#### Note: As we leverage a free subscription for the backend server, we request your patience in allowing some time (about 1 minute) for the server to start up (during which it will appear as if login has failed) when you attempt to log in for the first time in a while.  We advise you to wait a few moments before attempting the login again.

Q: Why can't we create admin accounts? <br>
A: Admin account creations should be done by an authorised member of Big At Hearts, therefore we have provided a sample account for testing.
